 SED2D is a SCHISM module that allows to compute sediment transport
 rate and bottom evolution in 2D mode.

 The total transport is computed based on empirical formulae and the 
 Exner equation is solved to update the bathymetry at each time step.

 This module is compiled if the key USE_SED2D is activated in the 
 Makefile.

 To use the model you need to setup a 2D SCHISM simulation, copy the
 sed2d.in.sample file in your work directory and rename it sed2d.in.
 Once the parameters in sed2d.in are set to the desired value, you
 only need to run the model (no additional files are required).

 The input parameters are written in the sed2d.out file which can
 be later used as a "light" input file.
