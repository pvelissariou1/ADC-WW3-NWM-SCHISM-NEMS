(1) Install sequence:

    elio
    lib
    xmgredit5
    xmvis6
    xmgr5

(2) needs libs (64 bit version): X11, Xm (open motif), gd; must have dev packages (i.e. with include/) for last 2.
    xmgr5 may also need postgres, netcdf (comment out in Makefile if not needed)

(3) Install steps on linux:
    14	15:03	cd ACE/
    20	15:04	cd elio/
                make
    23	15:04	cd ../lib
                make
    26	15:05	cp */*.a .
    29	15:05	cp ../elio/*.a .
    30	15:05	mkdir ../include
    31	15:05	cp */*.h ../include
    32	15:06	cp ../elio/*.h ../include
    33	15:06	ll ../include
    16	15:03	cd ../xmgredit5/  (need to increase MAXBOUNDS and MAXGRIDBOUNDS in defines.h for very large grid)
                make (can remove -Xp if it doesn't exist)
    36	15:06	cd ../xmvis6/ (need to increase MAXBOUNDS and MAXGRIDBOUNDS in defines.h for very large grid)
    41	15:07	vi Makefile (change some paths to the install dir; right now we used local dir)
    43	15:08	make clean

    46	15:09	make
                (If the make causes a problem, do:
    44	15:08	ls -al gram*
    45	15:09	rm gram.c gram.h (this is related to bison parsing util)
     (Note: bison (parsing util) should be available)
                )

     cd ../xmgr5
     rm -f pars.c pars.h 
     make pars.c (generate new pars.c with bison)
     vi Makefile (make sure NETCDF and PGSQL are commented out)
     make clean
     make

(4) The steps above can be followed for windows running cygwin and a X server (Xming, Exceed etc).
    You need to do a FULL installation of cygwin (with all packages).
