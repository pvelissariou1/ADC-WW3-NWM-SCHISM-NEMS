From Paul T. (Dec 2018):

new cmd option in gredit5 (code changes in bcwin.c and main.c):

xmgredit5 -bc bnd.bp hgrid.gr3

which generates boundary segment file bcs.bnd automatically using an input build point file (bnd.bp), 
where the list of points correspond to locations nearest to the start/end pairs of each open bnd segment.
All points should be unique.

The file bcs.bnd has the boundaries in a form that can be appended to hgrid.gr3 

When gredit opens, the open and land boundaries should be displayed as usual for inspection.
