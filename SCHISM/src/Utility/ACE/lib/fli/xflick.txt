About xflick:

	xflick allows to play fli-animations on a X11 machine.
	The original program was written by Ron Schell. 
	Some improvements were done by Michael Pall. 
	I just added extensions to play new fli-animations 
	which use higer resolution (mostly 640x480). 
	Example animations for this can be found at phoenix.oulu.fi
	in the directory ~/pub/bigflis. I tested the program 
	on workstations from SUN (SPARC 2 and 10) using some 
	examples from there.

History:

        xflick - Ron Schnell, March, 1991
	This code is provided as is, with no warrantees, expressed
        or implied.  I believe this code to be free of encumbrance,
        and offer it to the public domain.  I ask, however, that
	this paragraph and my name be retained in any modified
	versions of the file you may make, and that you notify me
	of any improvements you make to the code.

	The following changes are from Michael Pall
	(pall@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de) Mar 25-28 1991:

	Lots of bugfixes and changes to the structure of the files.
	The file is interpreted before we display it.
	Moved the interpretation part to read.c.
	We use Pixmaps and/or XImages.
	Added interactive input to change the speed/single step.


	The following extensions are from Klaus Ehrenfried
	(klaus@spock.es.go.dlr.de) Oct 23-24 1992:

	Add handling of FLI_DELTA and FLI_256_COLOR chunks.
	Recognize magic number FLC_MAGIC = 0xaf12 for newer 
	flic files.

Usage: xflick [-v] [-r<count>] [-d<delay>] [-i] [-n] file
 -v Verbose Debugging info
 -r<count>  Repeat count times
 -d<delay>  Delay between frames in 1/70s
 -i         Use XImages instead of Pixmaps (slower but some servers need it)
 -n         Don't interpret file before display (slower but uses less memory)
