m-lab scripts used to process CFSR files to sflux*.nc
CFSR files can be downloaded from rda.ucar.edu
Choose CFSRv2 hourly (from 1979) and use subset; select prmsl first as it's the pickiest, followed
 by wind, humidity, air T (select 'at 2m'), and then radiation fluxes @surface, then precip.
 Make sure time step is same for all vars (usually 6 hourly or analysis).
 Save as .zip. 

Beware that the atmos files may start from 06:00 and so you may want to have 1 extra month
 before the start of SCHISM run, to ensure proper time interpolation.
